# Github repository

In the home folder /home/yeroslaviz/ the github repository is stored. 

```
$ tree -L 1
.
├── BCFNGS-project-management
├── chemata
├── miniconda3
└── scripts
    └── deploy_shiny_server.sh
```

inside the Folder we can pull/push the changes we made to the repo from the local computer (AT WORK!!!).

the github repository on the local computer is at `/Documents/GitHub/BCFNGS-project-management`. 

To redeploy the server, one follows the following steps:

1. make the changes on the local computer (AT WORK!!!).
2. push the changes to the github repo
3. go to the folder `/home/yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management` on the VM `ngs-testing-vm` and pull the changes. 
4. Execute the `deploy_shiny_server.sh` script to copy the new changes to the shiny-server folder and restart both apache2 and the shiny-server. 

# Setting Environment variables

```{bash}

# /var/shiny-server/.Renviron
TZ=Europe/Berlin
LANG=en_US.UTF-8
LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8

```

# Install required system dependencies

```{bash}

sudo apt install -y libssl-dev libxml2-dev libcurl4-openssl-dev libudunits2-dev libgdal-dev

```

# Modify script for data base creation (setup_database.R -\> version 6 was modified here for production environment; app.R -\> version 6 was modified for interactive mode)

# Security

Not sure, if this is all necessary, will consult the IT when it is appropriate

## dedicated User

As we're planning to use the LDAP, I'm not sure, this is necessary.
I need a method to add specific users as admin

## Firewall

at the moment is not active, but maybe in the future.

```{bash}

sudo ufw allow 3838
sudo ufw allow 80
sudo ufw allow 443

```


# Changes on 14.11.2026

1. I would Like you to show me where the admin email address can be changed, if I want to have a different user as admin.
1.1 Please show me the parts of the script where this can be changed. 

The admin apssword is set here:

```{bash}
# Insert default admin user
default_password <- digest::digest("admin123")
dbExecute(con, "
  INSERT OR IGNORE INTO users (username, password, email, is_admin) 
  VALUES ('admin', ?, 'yeroslaviz@biochem.mpg.de', 1)
", params = list(default_password))
```

1.2 Can this be changed without recreating the whole databank or restart the app?
1.3 How do I change the admin email address without recreating the db?

This can be changed without recreating the database, using two options:

* Option 1: Direct database update

Run this SQL command on your database:

```{sql}

UPDATE users SET email = 'newadmin@institute.org' WHERE username = 'admin';

```

To execute this, we can either log in directly to the database via the command line 

```{bash}
sqlite3 sequencing_projects.db
```
and execute

```{bash}
UPDATE users SET email = 'newadmin@institute.org' WHERE username = 'admin';
.exit
```

or via the R pormpt:

```{r}
library(DBI)
library(RSQLite)
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "sequencing_projects.db")
dbExecute(con, "UPDATE users SET email = 'newadmin@institute.org' WHERE username = 'admin'")
dbDisconnect(con)
```

**Don't forget to modify the `setup_database_*.R` script afterwards, so these information will be also kept, if the database is recreated!**

* Option 2: Through the app's user management (as admin)

In the  "Administer Projects" tab, one can click "Manage Users" and change (or add) the admin user and edit their email.

1.4 How can I turn on/off sending the notification mail to the admin, if not needed?

The admin notification email is sent in the `send_project_creation_email` function in the app file. 


2. When creating a new project, an email is being sent.
2.1 can you please tell me to whome this email is being sent?
2.2 Can you show me the part of the script where it is set up?
2.3 Now, the Email should be sent to budget holder and to user, who created the project, as well as to the admin. Can this be changed easily, if needed?

This was done also in point 1. The function `send_project_creation_email` set the users who gets an email, when a project is created. 
the row 

```
        to = c(budget_holder$email, user_email, admin_emails),
```

set the recipient of the mail. we can remove one of the elements, or even just add a specific mail address to the `to =` row. 


3. How do I make changes to the cost estimations w.o. Recreating the db?
3.1 Is it possible to modify existing columns, in case prices are changing? Or would deleting and making a new element would be easier?
3.2 If I change anything in these tables, Would it also change it in the SQL data base?

At the moment the tables `Service types` and ` Sequencing depths` are not editable. If prices change, the easiet option is to delete the row and recreate it using the new value. This way, the older projects will use the previous costs, while the new one will get the new costs. 

One can also directly use the SQL commands to apply these chages, similar to above

```{bash}
sqlite3 sequencing_projects.db
```
and execute

```{bash}
UPDATE service_types SET costs_per_sample = 55 WHERE service_type = 'single cell/low mRNAseq';
.exit
```


4. something is wrong with the Sequencing Cycles Management table. When I run the app, go to the Admin projects Tab and click the Sequencing Cycles - Manage Cycles, I see this message: 
"Error: An error has occurred. Check your logs or contact the app author for clarification."
4.1 which log files can I consult?

When working on the server, the best place to look for problems are the log files of either the `apache2` (`/var/log/apache2/`) or the `shiny-server` (`/var/log/shiny-server/`).


5. Do I have a weekly backup of the SQL db? 

there is an app for a bi-weekly automaic backup. The function is for now commented out, so not working. 

## modify registration page


```{bash}
sqlite3 sequencing_projects.db
```

we add information to the registration page, so the user must choose a group. This way we know which is the budget holder for this user.

After ward we added the information to the Registration Server Logic

```{bash}
dbExecute(con, "
INSERT INTO users (username, password, email, phone, research_group, is_admin)
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, 0)
", params = list(
  input$reg_username,
  digest(input$reg_password),
  input$reg_email,
  input$reg_phone,
  input$reg_group
))
```

as well as modified the User registration modal


# Change connection to shiny server folder to https

The shiny app takes information from the config file under `/etc/shiny-server/shiny-server.conf`. Here we can see where the log files are written into and where the directory of the shiny app are stored. 

As the folder connected to the github repository is in my home directory `/home/yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management`, I need to create a softlink to the folder used by the app, so that it dsoesn't need to be copy-pasted each time.

```{bash}
sudo usermod -a -G shiny $USER # add user yeroslaviz to group shiny
sudo chown -R $USER:shiny sequencing-app/ # make group shiny able to execute the scripts in the folder
sudo mv /srv/shiny-server/sequencing-app/ /srv/shiny-server/sequencing-app.backup # move the actual hard-coded folder to a backup (just in case)
sudo ln -s /home/yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management/sequencing-app/ /srv/shiny-server/sequencing-app # create a soft-link to the github-connected folder.

```


# SSL Certificate (for HTTPS)

the new setting of the certificates. I have three files.

The rpivate key I created when applying for the certificate. The other two were downloaded, when the emial came
from Harica (the certificate provider).

the `PEM`  is the pem file and the `DER (issuer)` is the chain file. Both of them are needed.

Setting for the readability of the files:
```
cd /etc/apache2/certificate/2026
-rw------- 1 yeroslaviz b_mcf 3272 Nov 10 15:58 private-key.pem # udo chmod 600 /path/to/private.key  # Readable only by root
-rw-r--r-- 1 yeroslaviz b_mcf 1545 Nov 14 12:12 NGS_2026_Issuer_ChainFile.cer # sudo chmod 644 /path/to/chain.crt  # Readable by all
-rw-r--r-- 1 yeroslaviz b_mcf 2796 Nov 14 12:34 NGS_2026_Cert.pem # sudo chmod 644 /path/to/certificate.crt # Readable by all
```

All the files are saved under `/etc/apache2/certificate/2026`.

Now I created soft links for each of these files.

```{bash}
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/certificate/2026/private-key.pem /etc/ssl/private/2026_private-key.pem
sudo ln -s /etc/apache2/certificate/2026/NGS_2026_Cert.pem /etc/ssl/certs/2026_NGS_Cert.pem

```
