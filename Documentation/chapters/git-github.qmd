## GitHub Auth (new laptop)

### Fix GitHub auth error on a new laptop

Error message:

```
remote: Invalid username or token.
Password authentication is not supported for Git operations.
```

This means Git is trying to use HTTPS + password. GitHub no longer accepts account passwords for Git operations.

### Recommended fix (SSH)

1. Check current remote:

```bash
git remote -v
```

2. Create an SSH key (if you do not already have one):

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your_email@biochem.mpg.de"
```

3. Start agent and add the key:

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

4. Copy public key and add it to GitHub:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

GitHub: `Settings -> SSH and GPG keys -> New SSH key`

5. Switch repo remote to SSH:

```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management.git
```

6. Test and pull:

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
git pull origin main
```

### Fallback fix (HTTPS + PAT)

If SSH is not possible, use a Personal Access Token (PAT), not your account password.

1. Keep/set HTTPS remote:

```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management.git
```

2. Pull/push and enter:
- Username: your GitHub username
- Password: your PAT token

3. Optional (store credentials on macOS keychain):

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain
```

### Quick sanity check

```bash
git remote -v
git fetch origin
git status
```

For VM-side Git troubleshooting (divergent branches, stash/pull, merge conflicts), see **VM Troubleshooting Guide → Git / GitHub**.

## GitHub connection on VM (clone/pull/push)

Use SSH on the VM.

### Step 1: Create a VM SSH key

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "<your-github-email>" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_bcfngs_vm
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_bcfngs_vm
chmod 644 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_bcfngs_vm.pub
```

### Step 2: Load key and pin it in SSH config

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_bcfngs_vm
```

```bash
cat >> ~/.ssh/config <<'EOF'
Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_bcfngs_vm
  IdentitiesOnly yes
EOF
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/config
```

### Step 3: Add key in GitHub

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_bcfngs_vm.pub
```

Copy the full output (public key) and paste it in GitHub.
Do **not** paste the private key file.

Choose one:

1. **Deploy key (read-only)** on this repo: clone + pull only.
2. **User/account SSH key (write access)**: clone + pull + push.

Where to paste:

- Deploy key: [GitHub repo `BCFNGS-project-management`](https://github.com/yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management) -> `Settings` -> `Deploy keys` -> `Add deploy key`.
- User key: GitHub account -> `Settings` -> `SSH and GPG keys` -> `New SSH key`.

After choosing:

( for bcf-vm, we choose only deploy key, since we don't plan to push changes from here.)

```
If we do make any local changes, we must run the following before pulling new changes (since they will probably fail)

git stash push -m "vm-local"
git pull --ff-only origin main
git stash pop

```

- If you chose **Deploy key (read-only)**:

```bash
cd /home/<user>
git clone git@github.com:yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management.git
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

- If you chose **User/account SSH key (write access)**:

```bash
cd /home/<user>
git clone git@github.com:yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management.git
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git checkout -b <your-branch>
git push -u origin <your-branch>
```

Recommendation:

- On `ngs-vm` (production): use **Deploy key (read-only)**.
- On `bcf-vm` or local dev machines: use **User/account key** if you need push.

If you make local changes on a pull-only VM:

- Changes remain local.
- `git pull` can fail if local edits conflict with incoming changes.
- Safe pull pattern:

```bash
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git stash push -m "local-vm-work"
git pull --ff-only origin main
git stash pop
```

If `stash pop` conflicts, resolve conflicts manually.

### Step 4: Verify access

```bash
ssh -T git@github.com
git ls-remote git@github.com:yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management.git
```

## Enable push from the VM

If the VM currently uses a deploy key, push will be denied.
To allow push, use an SSH key attached to a GitHub user that has write permission.

Set Git identity on the VM:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Assa Yeroslaviz"
git config --global user.email "yeroslaviz@biochem.mpg.de"
git config --global pull.rebase false
```

Optional write test:

```bash
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git checkout -b test/vm-write-check
git push -u origin test/vm-write-check
```

If push succeeds, delete the test branch:

```bash
git checkout main
git branch -D test/vm-write-check
git push origin --delete test/vm-write-check
```


## Repo Setup on the VM

Clone once:

```bash
cd /home/<user>
git clone git@github.com:yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management.git
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git remote -v
```

If the repo already exists with HTTPS remote, switch it to SSH:

```bash
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management.git
```

Expected server layout:

```
/srv/shiny-server/
├── sequencing-app/
│ ├── app.R
│ ├── setup_database.R
│ ├── sequencing_projects.db
│ └── www/
  │ ├── logo.png
  │ └── minerva.png
```

## Daily VM Git workflow

Pull latest `main`:

```bash
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git checkout main
git pull --no-rebase origin main
```

Push your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b <your-branch>
git add .
git commit -m "your message"
git push -u origin <your-branch>
```

For pull conflicts/divergent branches, see **Troubleshooting → Git / GitHub**.

## Feature Branch Workflow (Recommended)

Use this flow for new features and bug fixes.

### Step 1: Start from updated `main`

```bash
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

### Step 2: Create and switch to a feature branch

```bash
git checkout -b codex/<short-feature-name>
```

### Step 3: Commit your work on the feature branch

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "<clear message>"
```

### Step 4: Push branch and open PR

```bash
git push -u origin codex/<short-feature-name>
```

Open a Pull Request from `codex/<short-feature-name>` -> `main`.

### Step 5: Test on VM from the same branch (optional but recommended)

```bash
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git fetch origin
git checkout codex/<short-feature-name>
git pull --ff-only origin codex/<short-feature-name>
PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://<vm-hostname>" ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Step 6: Merge PR, then sync local/VM to `main`

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

Optional cleanup:

```bash
git branch -d codex/<short-feature-name>
git push origin --delete codex/<short-feature-name>
```

## Quick Branch-To-Production Flow

Use this as the short operational checklist for normal feature delivery.

### Step 1: Start feature branch (local machine)

We first create feature branch locally.

```bash
cd /Users/yeroslaviz/Documents/Github/BCFNGS-project-management
# # Switches your working branch to main (or make sure I'm already in the branch)
git checkout main
# # --ff-only means “update only if this is a clean fast-forward.”.
# It prevents Git from creating an automatic merge commit during pull.
# This keeps history cleaner and avoids accidental branch divergence surprises.
git pull --ff-only origin main
# Creates a new branch with that name and immediately switches onto it
git checkout -b <feature-branch>
```


### Step 2: Commit and push (local machine)

```bash
git add <files>
```

running `git status` here will show the results of what we added to the new branch

```
$git status

On branch additional-cost-notifications
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
        modified:   Documentation/chapters/change-log.qmd
        modified:   Documentation/chapters/deploy-operations.qmd
        modified:   Documentation/chapters/git-github.qmd
        modified:   sequencing-app/app.R
        modified:   sequencing-app/setup_database.R
```

```bash
git commit -m "<message>"
git push -u origin <feature-branch> # The `-u` sets upstream so future pushes can be just git push
```

### Step 3: Test branch on test VM (`bcf-vm` or `ngs-testing-vm`)

The sequence would be: update remote info -> move to correct branch -> update branch safely.

```bash
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git fetch origin # update remote info - Downloads latest remote refs/commits, but don't touch your working files.
# # Switches working branch (or creates/tracks local branch from remote).
git checkout --track origin/<feature-branch>   # first time only
# or: git checkout <feature-branch>            # if local branch already exists
# Integrates any new commits from remote into your local branch. --ff-only guarantees no merge commit is created accidentally.
git pull --ff-only origin <feature-branch>
PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://<vm-hostname>" ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

Now, we can log in to the testing VM (e.g. `bcf-vm`) and test the new setting to see if everything works as expected. If we can see the new changes, continue to step 5 and merge the PR

### Step 4: Merge PR on GitHub

This should only be done, after the changes were varified on the test VM and were sucessfully integrated.

The `git push -u` command from step 2 has this output:

```
Enumerating objects: 19, done.
Counting objects: 100% (19/19), done.
Delta compression using up to 8 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (10/10), done.
Writing objects: 100% (10/10), 6.28 KiB | 1.25 MiB/s, done.
Total 10 (delta 8), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0 (from 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (8/8), completed with 8 local objects.
remote:
remote: Create a pull request for 'additional-cost-notifications' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management/pull/new/additional-cost-notifications
remote:
To github.com:yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management.git
 * [new branch]      additional-cost-notifications -> additional-cost-notifications
branch 'additional-cost-notifications' set up to track 'origin/additional-cost-notifications'.
```

it automatically creates a pull request for the new branch.

Then:

- Confirm base: main and compare: additional-cost-notifications.
- Click Create pull request.
- Review Files changed.
- Click Merge pull request (or Squash and merge if you prefer one commit).
- Click Confirm merge.


### Step 5: Sync local `main` after merge

```bash
cd /Users/yeroslaviz/Documents/Github/BCFNGS-project-management
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

### Step 6: Deploy `main` to production (`ngs-vm`)

```bash
cd /home/yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management
git checkout main
git pull --ff-only origin main
PUBLIC_BASE_URL="https://ngs-vm.biochem.mpg.de" ./scripts/deploy.sh
```

### Step 7: Optional branch cleanup

```bash
# local
git branch -d <feature-branch>

# remote
git push origin --delete <feature-branch>

# test VM (optional)
cd /home/<user>/BCFNGS-project-management
git checkout main
git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

### Step 8: Keep unmerged feature branches in sync with `main`

If you keep a feature branch open while `main` keeps changing, sync `main` into that branch before final merge.

This apply for example if If I have a new branch were I test a new feature. I don't merge it yet, but continue to modify the main branch.

Recommended (rebase):

```bash
git checkout <feature-branch>
git fetch origin
git rebase origin/main
git push --force-with-lease
```

Alternative (merge):

```bash
git checkout <feature-branch>
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main
git push
```

### Notes

- `--ff-only` avoids accidental merge commits on pull.
- `deploy.sh` deploys code and restarts app; it does not rebuild DB.
- Production deployment should use `main` unless an explicit pre-merge production test is required.
