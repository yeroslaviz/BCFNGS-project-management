# Welcome to the Sequencing Facility at MPI for Biochemistry

This is the repository of the shiny app for a project management system for the BCF NGS core facility

The NGS lab of the Core Facility is providing sequencing as a service. We highly recommend to contact us before the start of your experiment. In collaboration with the Bioinformatics Core Facility, we provide:

* Assistance with experimental design of the studies (required number of samples and replicates)
* Assistance with the use of NGS open source analysis tools
* Data analysis on collaborative basis

If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact us @ [omicsdesk](mailto:omicsdesk.biochem.mpg.de)!
