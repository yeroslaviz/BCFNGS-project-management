Apache vhost now proxies the app under `/sequencing-app/` and redirects the root URL to `/sequencing-app/?auth_user=<LDAP user>`.\n2. Removed a conflicting backup Apache config from `sites-enabled` that was overriding proxy rules.\n3. Quieted Apache LDAP logging by default and kept debug logging opt-in only.\n4. Restricted LDAP debug output in the Shiny app to `APP_ENV=dev` and `LDAP_DEBUG=1`.\n5. Expanded documentation with VM validation notes and a comprehensive error-checking checklist.\n\n**Key VM actions**\n\n1. Verified LDAP prompt and redirect behavior with `curl` and a real browser login.\n2. Confirmed the app is reachable at `http://localhost:3838/sequencing-app/` and via Apache at `https://ngs-testing-vm.biochem.mpg.de/sequencing-app/`.\n3. Removed backup Apache config from `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/` to eliminate conflicting `ProxyPass /` rules.\n4. Restarted Apache after each config change and validated with `apache2ctl -t`.\n\n**Validation results**\n\n1. LDAP login prompt appears and redirects to `/sequencing-app/?auth_user=<user>`.\n2. `yeroslaviz` is mapped to Cox and the correct PI.\n3. `yeroslaviz-test` (OU = NGS Facility) is treated as service group (no PI match).\n4. Email routing works for both cases (PI + NGS for research groups; admin fallback for service groups).\n5. Project creation works with LDAP-authenticated users.\n\n**Notes and decisions**\n\n1. The Shiny app does not reliably receive custom headers from Apache, so the query parameter fallback remains the most reliable method.\n2. Apache must not parse backup configs inside `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled`.\n3. LDAP debug logging is kept off in production to avoid noisy logs.\n\n**AI handoff snapshot (use this to resume later)**\n\n1. Repo: `/home/yeroslaviz/BCFNGS-project-management` on the VM and `/Users/yeroslaviz/Documents/Github/BCFNGS-project-management` locally.\n2. App path on VM: `/srv/shiny-server/sequencing-app/` (Shiny server `site_dir`).\n3. Apache vhost in use: `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/01-main.conf` (copied from repo root `01-main.conf`).\n4. Proxy rules in the active vhost: `/sequencing-app/` is proxied to `http://localhost:3838/sequencing-app/` and the root `/` redirects to `/sequencing-app/?auth_user=<REMOTE_USER>`.\n5. LDAP auth is enabled in Apache with `AuthLDAPURL` pointing to `ldaps://ldapserv1.biochem.mpg.de:636/dc=biochem,dc=mpg,dc=de?uid?sub?(objectClass=posixAccount)`.\n6. LDAP trust is configured in `/etc/ldap/ldap.conf` with `TLS_CACERTDIR /etc/ssl/certs` (typo fixed earlier).\n7. Shiny env vars (production): `AUTH_MODE=ldap`, `LDAP_URI=ldaps://ldapserv1...`, `LDAP_BASE_DN=dc=biochem,dc=mpg,dc=de`.\n8. Debug is opt-in only: set `APP_ENV=dev` and `LDAP_DEBUG=1` to enable debug logs in Shiny.\n9. Validation checks succeeded: `curl -Ik https://HOST/` returns 401, `curl -Ik -u USER https://HOST/` returns 302 to `/sequencing-app/?auth_user=USER`, and `curl -Ik -u USER https://HOST/sequencing-app/` returns 200.\n10. User mapping and email routing are confirmed working for both a research group user and a service group user.\n11. Admin access in LDAP mode is done by promoting LDAP users in SQLite (see `Server_preparations.qmd` and `notes/vm-troubleshooting-guide.md`).\n12. Auth mode switching is done via `systemctl edit shiny-server` by changing `AUTH_MODE` (LDAP vs local) and restarting the service.\n\n**AI restart recipe**\n\n1.
